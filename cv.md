## About myself
I'm 22 years old. I've graduated from Minsk State Linguistic University and interpreter and intercultire communication specialist by education. I have two part time jobs as an English tutor and as an administrator in the Service center in Minsk. But for me only knowing some languages is not enough, so I've decided to take some new challenges in my life and started learning programming. This is utterly a challenge for me as for a humanitarian. I have good communication skills and I'm completely reliable and responsible at work.
